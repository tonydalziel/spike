## Spiking Report App
#The Goal
The goal of this project is to design a website to help inform students of locations where alleged spiking incidents have occured. The goal is to implement this across the UK.

#Current Status
Currently, the website has a basic front end with the option to input a report, make and register an account, and to view reports throughout Durham.

#Next Steps
Another student is currently developing the backend API for storing reports and sending data to the front end. I hope to add more features to the webpage for viewing reports and making reports more efficiently. I would also like to add detail verification to the login page etc.
